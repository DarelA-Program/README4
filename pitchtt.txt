*The game is about to characters who are in a maze and they will have to face
many (obsticles or levels) and the goal is to finish first.

* For the charactars I was thinking about using famous charactars like: Mario ,Luigi or Kirby.

*Each charactar must run as fast as they can to reach to the finish line.
 There will be various obstables to prevent them to reach to there goal.
 For example: there will be objects, enemies and so on... 

*The first charactar to reach to the finish line wins. If you get hit a certain amount of time by the obstacles
 you automatically loss and the winner will be your adversaire.

*As you reach closer to the finish line the difficulty will increase. There will be more objets and  obstacles on your way
 to prevent you to reach your goal. The maze will be moving making it hard for you to run to the finish line.

*My source of insparation was the game Mario. I love that game. 

*I would like to be paired with someone who has an idea of game similar to mine.
 Also someone who is sociable and that works well.
